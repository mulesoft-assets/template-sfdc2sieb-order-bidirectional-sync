# License Agreement <a name="licenseagreement"/>
Note that using this template is subject to the conditions of this [License Agreement](AnypointTemplateLicense.pdf).
Please review the terms of the license before downloading and using this template. In short, you are allowed to use the template for free with Mule ESB Enterprise Edition, CloudHub, or as a trial in Anypoint Studio.

# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
As a Salesforce admin I want to have my Orders syncronized between Salesforce and Oracle Siebel Business Objects.

This Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online bi-directional sync of Orders between Salesforce and Oracle Siebel Business Objects, being able to specify filtering criterias. 

The integration main behaviour is polling for changes (new Order or modified ones) that have occured either in Salesforces or Siebel during a certain defined period of time. For those Orders that both have not been updated yet the integration triggers an upsert (update or create depending the case) taking the last modification as the one that should be applied.

In this template you have option to decide whether to use the traditional Polling trigger flow which will repeatedly poll source for changes and updates or you can decide to use the Push Notification trigger flow which reflects changes in source instantly. Everytime there is a new order or a change in an already existing one, the integration template will receive notification instantly from Salesforce or Siebel instance and it will be responsible for updating the order on the target.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to stablish starting point to adapt the integration to any given requirements.

### Template overview
Let's say we want to keep Salesforce instance synchronized with Siebel. Then, the integration behavior can be summarized just with the following steps:

1. Ask Salesforce:
> *Which changes have there been since the last time I got in touch with you?*

2. For each of the updates fetched in the previous step (1.), ask Siebel:
> *Does the update received from Salesforce should be applied?*

3. If Siebel answer for the previous question (2.) is *Yes*, then *upsert* (create or update depending each particular case) Siebel with the belonging change

4. Repeat previous steps (1. to 3.) the other way around (using Database as source instance and Salesforce as the target one)

 Repeat *ad infinitum*:

5. Ask Salesforce:
> *Which changes have there been since the question I've made in the step 1.?*

And so on...

# Considerations <a name="considerations"/>

To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failling to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**
+ Add text custom field SiebelOrder__c to Order object. This will store Siebel Order Header Id, which is then used to find the matching existing order in Siebel.
+ Add text custom field SiebelExternalId__c to Product2 object. And fill it with appropriate value of matching Product Id from Siebel. There should be 1 to 1 relation between Products in Salesforce and Siebel.

For setting up Push notification these extra steps needs to be done
+ Define Salesforce outbound messaging and a simple workflow rule on Order object. [This article will show you how to accomplish this](https://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/Content/sforce_api_om_outboundmessaging_setting_up.htm). The most important setting here is the `Endpoint URL` which needs to point to your application running on Cloudbhub, eg. `http://yourapp.cloudhub.io:80`. Additionaly, try to add just few fields to the `Fields to Send` to keep it simple for begin.
+ Deploy custom script to your Siebel instance which will send notification to the Siebel Inbound Http connector whenever order in Siebel is updated.
+ Set Initial State of Pollinn inbound flows to Stopped and Http inboud flows to Started.
+ Deploy the template to Cloudhub.



## Salesforce Considerations <a name="salesforceconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Salesforce, in order for this template to work.

In order to have this template working as expected, you should be aware of your own Salesforce field configuration.

### As source of data

If the user configured in the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then a *InvalidFieldFault* API fault will show up.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault [ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='
Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]
]
```

### As destination of data

There are no particular considerations for this Anypoint Template regarding Siebel as data destination.
## Siebel Considerations <a name="siebelconsiderations"/>

There may be a few things that you need to know regarding Siebel, in order for this template to work.

This Anypoint Template may be using date time/timestamp fields from the Siebe in order to do comparisons and take further actions.
While the template handles the time zone by sending all such fields in a neutral time zone, it can not find out on its on the time zone in which the Siebel instance is on.
It will be up to the user of this template to provide such information. To find out more about Siebel time zones please check the following [link](http://docs.oracle.com/cd/B40099_02/books/Fundamentals/Fund_settingoptions3.html)

+ sfdc.pricebook.id=01s20000001SwEQAA0

# API Calls <a name="apicalls"/>
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + 2*X + X / 200 + Y ***

Being ***X*** the number of Orders to be synchronized on each run and ***Y*** the number of Order line Items. 

The division by ***200*** is because, by default, Orders are gathered in groups of 200 for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that this calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.


# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>
This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Anypoint Template is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Anypoint Template.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [endpoints.xml](#endpointsxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
Functional aspect of the Anypoint Template is implemented on this XML, directed by a batch job that will be responsible for creations/updates. The severeal message processors constitute four high level actions that fully implement the logic of this Anypoint Template:

1. Job execution is invoked from triggerFlow (endpoints.xml) everytime there is a new query executed asking for created/updated Contacts.
2. During the Process stage, each Salesforce contact will be filtered depending on, if it has an existing matching contact in the Siebel and vise versa.
3. The last step of the Process stage will group the contacts and create/update them either in Salesforce or Siebel.
Finally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will logoutput statistics data into the console.



## endpoints.xml<a name="endpointsxml"/>
This is file is conformed by a Flow containing the Poll that will periodically query either in Salesforce or Siebel for updated/created Contacts that meet the defined criteria in the query. And then executing the batch job process with the query results.



## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
Contains a [Catch Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Catch+Exception+Strategy) that is only Logging the exception thrown (If so). As you imagine, this is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions.
